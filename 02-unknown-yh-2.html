                The walk there was excruciating. The summer sun was shining on the concrete surrounding me, reflecting
                in all the tall buildingsâ€™ windows and burning down on me, melting away my energy with every step I
                took. The electrical fields seemed not to help with that, making the sunrays feel even more like they
                were burning the flesh off my bones.

                Standing in front of the building, I felt a sense of safety. I had found a place to stay. At least until
                tomorrow.
