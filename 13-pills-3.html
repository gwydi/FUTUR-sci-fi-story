            <h1>Main Story</h1>
            <p>
                What I did know was that I took these pills every day. They made my body feel weak and my mind feel
                sleepy, like a sleeping pill that works within 2 minutes, I took them, and I fell asleep every time. I
                felt good when I took them, but I honestly had no clue what they really did to me.

                As I studied the pills, placing them in my palm and taking them close to my eyes, I wondered if I really
                needed them. My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door and an irritated voice telling me to
                take the pills, or measures would be taken.
                It was time to decide. Should I swallow the pills as I am told to fall into that mysterious sleep again,
                or muster up the courage and let the pills disappear somehow?
