            <h1>I want to visit the famous Cecil Hotel</h1>
            <p>
                I decided to check out the Cecil Hotel. It was quite at a distance from my current location, but I had
                heard ghost stories from the famously haunted hotel since I was a kid. The horrifying stories made their
                way around and manifested itself in with bad reputation for the once glamorous hotel, which now could
                barely stay afloat.
