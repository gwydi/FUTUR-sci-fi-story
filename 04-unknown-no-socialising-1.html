                After a quick glance at the group, I turned my head back to the receptionist and nodded. After a short,
                awkward moment of silence I thanked her for the information and help, grabbed my bag and made my way to
                the second floor. The stairway was narrow, and the air smelled stale. The hallway leading to the
                bedrooms and facilities were painted in a very unappealing sand colour. To save the look, the doors had
                small pictographs on them, which added a playful touch but made the look almost too childish.
