            <h1>Main Story</h1>
            <p>
                Lost in my thoughts, indifference started filling up my mind and for a second it felt like time was
                frozen. The space around me went quiet and slow and I felt free. This peaceful moment was interrupted
                when a well-dressed man bumped into me and angrily told me to get the *&#!? out of the way.
                Startled, I lifted my heavy backpack off the concrete sidewalk and took a few steps towards a wall. Not
                knowing where to go but in desperate need of a place to leave some of my essentials, I looked at a map
                and looked for a place to stay.
