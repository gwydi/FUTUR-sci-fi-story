            <h1>In the youth hostel</h1>
            <p>
                The group consisted of two taller men who I assumed were in their early twenties and a woman about the
                same age. All had blonde hair and a shiny attitude that must attract people. I thanked the receptionist
                for her help and decided to take a leap and approach the group.
                They told me about their stay here. Two of them were from a Nordic European country I can't recall the
                name of, the other one is from the city. I was surprised that the two foreigners were able to be here.
                For months all the news talked about was the devastation the Masquis caused in Europe. They started
                destroying anything that was in their way, leaving ruins and dried up vegetation behind, so bad that
                most parts were now inhabitable.
                I was pulled back out of my thoughts as the woman invited me to join them for a party tonight. As
                tempted as I felt, I wasnâ€™t in the mood for being dependent on other people. Politely I declined and
                made my way to the room to drop off my bag.
                Making my way to the room, I passed various doors with pictographs on them and as I passed the one with
                the shower on it, I spotted a few drops of blood on the floor leading into the washroom.
