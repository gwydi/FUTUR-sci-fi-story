            <p>
                I didnâ€™t feel safe anymore taking the pills. Now I just had to make them disappear. I pretended to throw
                them in my mouth as usual but held them tight in my hand, then brought the hand down to my pocket and
                put them in there.
                terrified of being caught I continued my usual routine of sitting on my bed for about a minute and then
                laying down. To my surprise I heard the footsteps outside disappear into the unknown further outside.
