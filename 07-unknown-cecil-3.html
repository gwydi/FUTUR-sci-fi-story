            <p>
                Standing in front of the hotel made me feel like looking into the past, a long-gone time. It was one of
                the oldest buildings in Los Angeles, brick walls reached thirteen stories high into the sky and for a
                second I questioned if maybe time was frozen for it. These old constructions were bound to be destroyed
                by the extreme weather phenomena that increased over the last few decades. But this one seemed to stand
                strong, as if time wasnâ€™t affecting it at all. With its thirteen stories, it was still a rather small
                building in the growing metropolitan city with a population of roughly 40 million people.
