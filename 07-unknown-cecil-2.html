                The way to the hotel was excruciating. The summer sun was shining on the concrete surrounding me,
                reflecting in all the tall buildingsâ€™ windows and burning down on me, melting away my energy with every
                step I took. The electrical fields seemed not to help with that, making the sunrays feel even more like
                they were burning the flesh off my bones. For a quicker way I decided to take a bus, which turned out to
                be underwhelmingly crowded, hot and stenchy.
