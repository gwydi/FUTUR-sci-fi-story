            <p>
                I donâ€™t remember how long I laid there on my back, not making a move or sound until I sled off into
                sleep. It could have been hours. I thought of the experiences I had. Were they a dream? A memory?
                Reality? And how long had I really been in this weird, sterile and cold room? For the first time in
                ages, it felt like I was able to think again. What was true? I doze off.
