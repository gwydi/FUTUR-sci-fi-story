            <p>
                The hallway walls were covered in a beige wallpaper covered with a flower pattern, it looked old and
                tiring. I entered my room. To my unpleasant surprise, the carpet in my room had the same colour as the
                mentioned wallpaper. The walls also didn’t change. Beige in beige. If suddenly gravity were to leave
                this room, I wouldn’t be able to tell carpet from walls. The monotonous sound from the air conditioning
                machine matched the whole feel of the hotel room. I laid down on the bed, looked at the ceiling and
                sighed. As boring as this beige seemed, it was better than home. Excited yet exhausted I took a deep
                breath and thought about what to do next.
