                I laid on my back as more and more Masquis started racing towards my now almost lifeless body and looked
                at the sky. The black swarm had loosened up and I was able to spot the beautiful, vibrant colours of the
                sunset. As the sun was swallowed by the horizon, so was my body by the Masquis. I closed my eyes in
                disbelief and saw a white light shine in the distance. Was there something after this?
