                A buzzing sound woke me. I couldn't tell how long I had slept, but as I opened my eyes, that question
                became quite irrelevant. Floating above my face was a large Masquis, bigger and uglier than I remembered
                them. It came ever closer to me but at a very slow speed. Frightened, I rolled out of my bed, fell to
                the floor and immediately noticed that my body felt weak. My vision blurred, and I could only crawl on
                the ground for a bit.
