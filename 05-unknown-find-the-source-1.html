            <p>
                Alarmed by the blood, I wanted to see if someone needed help. Facing the washroom, I gathered up my
                courage and slowly pushed open the door, that was only ajar.
                A boy in his teens was leaning over the sink. He looked annoyedly at his hands that also had blood on
                them, it was not a lot but enough that it made me think he could be seriously injured. With a quick
                move, he looked at me and I saw blood running from his nose, over the lower half of his face and
                dripping into the sink and his hands. He smiled and I got a glance at his bloodstained teeth, as he told
                me not to worry, he got horribly strong nosebleeds too often to really care anymore.
                Then I went to check out the room and drop my things off. It had two bunk beds on each side wall and a
                table right by the window. The chairs were limited to two, since the general idea was probably that
                people would spend their time outside the hotel besides the night and otherwise go to the community
                spaces.
                I put my bag down and sat on the chair to look out the window and enjoy the rest for a bit.
