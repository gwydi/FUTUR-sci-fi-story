            <p>
                As I came back to consciousness, I found myself in a bare, white cell without a window. There was no
                doorknob on the door, just a peephole, a lock and a small gate right on the floor. The only thing
                adorning the walls was a painting of a picturesque landscape that I would never be able to visit. In the
                corner there was a bed with a thin mattress and a flat pillow. A place of hopelessness, monotony and
                isolation.
