            <h1>Inside Cecil Hotel</h1>
            <p>
                An elderly man was sitting behind the oak counter and greeted me friendly when I approached the
                reception. He seemed like a bubbly person, helpful and warm-hearted. We quickly exchanged a few words
                and even though I don’t see the meaning of small talk, I felt like a bit of warmth filled my heart.
                Slightly trembling he handed me the key to my room. Number 312. For a short moment I thought of my
                parents’ house, where I took off 2 weeks ago. Greenwood street 312. Without a second thought, I held the
                key a bit tighter, took my backpack off the ground and headed to the third floor.
