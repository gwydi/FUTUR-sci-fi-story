                I wanted to check out the local night life. Around the corner of my night site there was a seemingly
                popular club. A small crowd of young adults had gathered around the entrance, chittering and chatting
                with each other. Without drawing too much attention I made my way to the doors of the club. The security
                guard checked my ID and pockets and took a step aside to signal I could enter.
