            <p>
                More and more I became one with everything. The blasting bass resonated through my body, making my
                heartbeat align with it. The air that once filled my lungs now filled up the room with every exhalation
                I made. I felt like the room was filled with me and I was filled with the room, becoming one. I felt
                every vibration, every move, every touch. I opened my eyes, and the impressions overwhelmed me. Colours
                I had never seen before displaying beautiful patterns on the walls and the ceiling. Overpowered by
                curiosity I looked up and indifferently noticed my sense of balance was not actively helping me stand up
                anymore.

                My body tipped over and in slow motion I saw all the beauty vanish around me as my vision turned black.
