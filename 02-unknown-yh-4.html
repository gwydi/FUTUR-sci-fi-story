            <p>
                Behind the reception counter was a young woman, she looked almost too young to be working here. After a
                short conversation, I was able to book a bed for a night in a shared room, pointing out the pool players
                as my roommates for the night. I turned my head to look at them again. For just a second I studied the
                group.
