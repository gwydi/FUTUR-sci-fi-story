            <h1>Inside Cecil Hotel</h1>
            <p>
                I decided to take a walk around the hotel hallways. A nap would do me no good considering my dreams got
                worse again. I took the room key and closed the thin, wooden door behind me. The floors creaked as I
                walked towards a panel. The colourful flyers immediately took my attention as they interrupted the muted
                tones of the beige walls.
