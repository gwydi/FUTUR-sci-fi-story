            <p>
                When I arrived in Los Angeles, I felt uneasy about the future. I had almost completely used up the
                savings I had worked months for, just to get a ticket to get away from home and now, here I was,
                standing in the middle of the sidewalk and I had no idea where to go to. Iâ€™d never been to this - or any
                other - enormous city before and the car filled streets and crowded sidewalks felt extremely
                overwhelming to me. I took a deep breath.
                The polluted air tingled in my airways. I grew up in a small town, surrounded by farmland, where
                everyone knows everyone, and news spread like a virus in an enclosed environment. Los Angeles felt
                anonymous, no one knew where I came from or who I was, and no one cared.
