            <h1>Main Story</h1>
            <p>
                I saw endless fields of farmland, roads leading nowhere, tiny houses passing by and people going about
                their daily business as I sat in the passenger seat of a truck. The windows were rolled down and the
                warm air filled the car with a calming breeze and a constant, soft sound. At first, I couldn’t see who
                the driver was, they were facing the other way, not looking at the street. Concernedly I tried to catch
                their attention.
