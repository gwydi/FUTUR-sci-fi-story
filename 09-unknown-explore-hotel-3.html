            <p>
                An intensifying buzzing sound tore me out of my thoughts. Coming from the unprotected countryside I
                instinctively jumped into fight, flight or freeze mode. A buzzing was usually the call to grab a shocker
                and keep your eyes open for any Masquis roaming your surroundings. But I was in the best protected city
                of the NorthAmerican continent. I shook the quivering feeling out of my bones and allowed my breathing
                to return to a normal pattern again.
