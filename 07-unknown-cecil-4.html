            <h1>I want to visit the famous Cecil Hotel</h1>
            <p>
                I pushed open the entrance door with the last bit of energy left in my body. A stream of cold air hit my
                face as I entered an unexpectedly imposing environment. The lobby had a luxurious touch. A red carpet
                stretched from the entrance, past the reception, all the way to the elevators and a majestic chandelier
                was hanging from the ceiling. The antique touch appealed to me. The houses in the town where I used to
                live were built at a similar time, but they just looked dilapidated and old. The Cecil hotels staff must
                have put a lot of work in the maintenance of the facility. It looked just the way it did when they had
                just started business many decades ago.
