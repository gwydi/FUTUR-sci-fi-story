            <p>
                The drivers head started turning and at the same pace the car started accelerating. Panic arose, the
                wind started howling and the sound shifted to a buzzing. Anxiously I looked around. The once peaceful
                landscape looked like a dried out, abandoned wasteland. Masquis everywhere, speeding towards the car
                like a starving predator hunting its prey. Portraying the horrible destruction, they had created in
                parts of the world. We had to get away from there, now! My screaming got swallowed completely under the
                ear wrecking buzzing that the Masquisâ€™ wings made. I turned my head to the driver who was now facing me.
                Dead eyes staring back at me, my dead eyes.
