                There was a pinboard hanging on the wall between the second and third door on the left side. I read
                through some of the ads, flyers and posters. “In need of a ...” was the theme of most of the handwritten
                ones. Some flyers advertised new products and sales at local stores. A few notes announced that
                different corporations were hiring. A few also warned about the Masquis’ destruction all over the planet
                as they started leaving regions inhabitable. One poster caught my interest. There was a big party at a
                club just around the corner tonight. I noted it on my inner calendar in hope I wouldn’t forget about it.
                Now was the time to drop off my bag. I slowly started walking along the hallway looking for my door and
                as I passed the one with the shower on it, I spotted a few drops of blood on the floor leading into the
                washroom.
