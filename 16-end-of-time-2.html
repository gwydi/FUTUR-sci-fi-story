            <p>
                I got up and realized for the first time that the room I was in wasn't really a room at all, but merely
                the ruins of one. The roof was gone, and only two of the walls remained standing. Stepping through the
                rubble that was once the wall beside my bed, I laid eyes on the devastation that the Masquis had
                wrought. No building stood taller than two floors. The streets were littered with debris and bloodless
                bodies. On the hills in the distance, there was no vegetation left.
