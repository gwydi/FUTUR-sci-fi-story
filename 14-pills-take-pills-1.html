                I had to take the pills; it was not worth risking my wellbeing for, who knows what these people could do
                to me.
                I brought the hand that was already holding the pills ready up to my mouth and with a quick motion threw
                them in my mouth. They tasted sweet, just as I remembered them, but if you let them in your mouth for
                too long, the taste would turn bitter, and the mysterious people outside would know. With a gulp, I
                swallowed all three of them down and waited for the effect of tiredness to kick in. Preparedly I walked
                over to my bed and sat down on the extremely hard mattress. When I felt my head get dizzy, I laid down
                on my back and waited for sleep to kick in.
