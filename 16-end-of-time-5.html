                My train of thought was interrupted by a sharp pain in my back, a sting. Now, everything sped up, the
                Masquis swarm started moving faster. The one that had been right over my head when I first woke up was
                now piercing my back. There was no time anymore. I felt the blood leave my body, my legs began to
                weaken, and I fell to the ground.
