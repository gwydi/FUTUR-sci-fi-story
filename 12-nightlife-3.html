                The girl at the bar mixed me her recommended drink and handed it over with a sweet smile. The name of
                the clear mixture was lost to the void of all the things I can't remember. It tasted sour and sweet at
                the same time, and I felt glad to have trusted her with choosing my drink. After a few sips of it, the
                urge to move my body besides being completely exhausted overcame my consciousness. So, I downed the rest
                of it and with closed eyes moved to the rhythm of the electronical music that was taking control over my
                brain.
