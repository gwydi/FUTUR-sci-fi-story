            <p>
                In the bigger cities, there were also extremely strict security measures because of the Masquis, as we
                called them. A strong electrical field stretched like a flat dome over the metropolitan areas, killing
                every single one of them off that tried to enter. The Masquis were genetically altered mosquitos,
                created in a laboratory in attempt to cure Malaria. The Malaria mosquitos spread further around the
                planet when temperatures rose due to climate change. After years of change for the better, worse came.
                The altered mosquitos started changing. It was first noticed when more and more people in humid
                environments started suffering from anaemia, then the mosquitos started growing bigger and bigger, their
                physique changed. Now they look dystopic, like nothing you’ve ever seen about the size of a mouse, with
                wings strong enough to fly faster than you can run and stingers sharper than any needle. The Masquis now
                require around 1 litre of blood per day to survive, and there are many of them. They took millions of
                lives and there’s not much we can do since they spread at rates too high to control. So, we stay inside,
                keep the shockers close and securely cover urban areas with electrical fields.
