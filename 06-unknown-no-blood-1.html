            <p>
                Not too shocked by a few drops of blood, I decided to walk past them and find my room. It had two bunk
                beds on each side wall and a table right by the window. The chairs were limited to two, since the
                general idea was probably that people would spend their time outside the hotel besides the night and
                otherwise go to the community spaces.
                I put my bag on one of the upper beds and looked out the window. Time was passing in a weird way. It had
                just been noon and what felt like an hour later, dusk was coming already. Through the blue shimmering of
                the electrical shield, I could see the vibrant colours of the sunset. For a few minutes I sat down on
                the chair and watched the world move as I sat and rested.
