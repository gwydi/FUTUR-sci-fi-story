            <p>
                With a sudden movement I woke up drenched in sweat. The dreams had gotten worse again over the last few
                weeks, but this was new. I got up and splashed cold water in my face. The person staring back at me in
                the mirror didn’t look like me. The last few months were hard if you didn’t live in the developed
                cities. The drought caused most crops to die off in the region, so food was scarce good. My eyes were
                close to the only thing I could still recognise as me. Slowly coming back out of my dream and my mind, I
                realised that the buzz was still there.
