                It was like taking a step into the last decade as I entered the youth hostel. The walls were pale, old
                wooden furniture was cramped in the tiny entrance room, that was used both as a lobby and a community
                room at once. Three young-looking people were playing pool in a corner, while two older,
                touristy-looking men were loudly arguing about their plans for the next day over a beer. They were sat
                at a table in the other corner by the window.
