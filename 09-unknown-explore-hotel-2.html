                Various ads and announcements were posted on the magnetic whiteboard that was barely visible under all
                the vibrant pieces of paper. I read through some of them. “In need of a ...” was the theme of most of
                the handwritten ones. Some flyers advertised new products and sales at local stores. A few notes
                announced that different corporations were hiring. A few also warned about the Masquis’ destruction all
                over the planet as they started leaving regions inhabitable. One poster caught my interest. There was a
                big party at a club just around the corner tonight. I noted it on my inner calendar in hope I wouldn’t
                forget about it.
