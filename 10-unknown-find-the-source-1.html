                I decided to find out where the absorbing sound is coming from. I slowly took step after step and
                followed the sound as it took control of my path. I almost felt spellbound following that noise. As it
                got louder, closer, I felt my muscles tensing up. I felt that the sound must be coming from just around
                the corner, so I gathered up all my courage and with one big step and turn, I positioned myself in sight
                of the potential threat.
