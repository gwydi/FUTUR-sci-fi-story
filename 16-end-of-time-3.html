                What shocked me the most was the view I got when I looked up. The sky was almost completely covered by a
                black mass of swarming Masquis. The gross black mass felt almost hypnotising for a short moment. Slowly,
                a group of Masquis started to detach itself from the huge swarm overhead. Then, I realized that time was
                not progressing at its usual speed. It was somehow slowed down.
