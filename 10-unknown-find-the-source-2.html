            <h1>Inside Cecil Hotel</h1>

                Then I was able to see the source of the buzzing. An electrician looked at me puzzled as I stood there
                and looked back at him confusedly. With an irritated side eye, he refocused on fixing a sort of wire
                that was hanging out of the fuse box. Startled but relieved, I make my way back through the pale
                hallways and back to my room.
